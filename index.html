        <p>Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Amelia developed an interest in caring for soldiers wounded in World War I. In 1918 she left junior college to become a nurses aide in Toronto. After the war, Earhart entered the premed program at Columbia University in New York City but left in 1920 after her parents insisted that she live with them in California. She went on her first airplane ride in 1920, an experience that prompted her to take flying lessons. Her disappearance was during a flight around the world in 1937</p>

After the Montgomery bus boycott, Rosa Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. She served as secretary in the Montgomery division of NAACP for 14 years from 1943 to 1957 during which she played a key role in mobilizing support for the rape victim Recy Taylor and bringing the incident to national notice. </p>

This book was hailed for its revolutionary approach and became a part of the movement.</p>
